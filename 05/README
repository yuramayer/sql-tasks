# AVG Session Time

Calculate each user's average session time, where a session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and a page_exit.

Assume each user has only one session per day. If there are multiple page_load or page_exit events on the same day, use only the latest page_load and the earliest page_exit.

Only consider sessions where the page_load occurs before the page_exit on the same day.

Output the user_id and their average session time.
